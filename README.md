The primary purpose of the course is to learn-by-doing advanced
software engineering techniques including:
1. Big Data
1. Text analysis, e.g., LLMs, Word2Vec, GloVe, NMF, LDA, LSTM
2. Image analysis, e.g., RCNN, Mask-RCNN, CAM, ...
3. Network analysis, network databases (neo4j), ...

Each of the techniques will be learned through work on a real project. 

Tthree outcomes for this class: 
- present an existing research paper on any SE topic (prepared with a team)
- produce and present an innovative software project (a tool, paper, dataset as an outcome) also prepared with a team
- complete a set of tasks
